# Fives (Word Game)

Fives by Jon Dolan is a fun and entertaining word game available at http://fives.jondolan.me

### Objective
The objective of the game is to use 10 guesses to eliminate potential letters in search of the five letter word!

---

There are currently 4 game modes - classic, practice, time trial, and multiplayer.

### Classic
Classic mode is how the game is intended to be played. There are 10 guesses, and for each guess the player knows the number of letters in the right place (as in, in the same place in the word and the guess) and the number of letters in the wrong place (as in the letters in both words but in different positions in each). You don't know which letters the numbers are referring to, directly at least! It's a challenge! Develop a strategy and stick to it!

### Practice
Practice mode tones it down a step. Instead of the number of letters in the right place or wrong place, it highlights the letters green and yellow respecitvely. Use this mode to learn your way around the game and see patterns.

### Time Trial
My personal favorite mode combines the rules of classic mode with the pressure of a clock. Be sure to tweet your time to @FivesWordGame! In order to make this mode a little more fun, the guess limit has been upped to 15!

### Multiplayer
This multiplayer is local and is intended for a classroom-like setting (after all, that's how this game started!). One person picks the word, instead of the computer, and the rest of the players are tasked with trying to guess that word. This mode also abides by the standard classic rules.
